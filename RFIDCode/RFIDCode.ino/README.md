#I have been using readily available resources to develop a door authentication system that detects and authenticates RFID to open and lock a door.
   -The fascinating thing about this project is that I have developed it for normal doors. Without a solenoid lock.
#It has been FUN!!!Stressful at times when it didn't work, but fun either way.To the next project
